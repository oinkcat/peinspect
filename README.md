# PE format executable information utility

This is simple utility that provides various information about Windows PE (Portable Executable) executables (.EXE, .DLL, etc.) and can extract some data from its.
It's done as my Golang learning project. Can still be be buggy.

### Features:
- Provide basic info about executable
- Provide Sections/Imports/Exports information
- Section dump
- Resources listing and extraction

### TODO:
- Correct icon resource extraction (with header)
- Better usage help message
